### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Timothy Burr Finn. The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my software engineering skills to prospective employers. 

Specific portfolio projects are provided that target my knowledge of several programming languages (C++, C# and Python). The project is a simulation of an x-ray image acquistion system with functionality to collect and analyze images of different types. Below you will find a link to three code repositories, one for each language. Inside each repository you will find a solution which can be downloaded and executed.

The project is currently a work in progress and does not currently represent a completed implementation.

The following software engineering skills that I have and wish to demonstrate are found in the software solutions:

- System Requirements Definition 
- UML Documentation in support of System and Deployment Modeling
- Acceptance, System, Component Integration, Unit Testing
- Object Oriented Software Design
- Multithreading
- Database Design
- GUI Design
