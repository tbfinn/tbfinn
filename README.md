### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Timothy Burr Finn. This is my portfolio project. The purpose of this portfolio project is to demonstrate my knowledge of several programming languages (C++, C# and Python) and my general software engineering abilities. Below you will find a link to my three Portfolio-Solution repositories, one for each language. Inside each repository you will find a project which can be downloaded and executed.
