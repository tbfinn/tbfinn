### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Timothy Burr Finn. This is my portfolio project. The purpose of this portfolio project is to demonstrate my knowledge of several programming languages (C++, C# and Python) and my general software engineering abilities. Below you will find a link to my Portfolio-Solution repository. Inside that repository you will find 3 projects, one for each language, which can be downloaded and executed.
