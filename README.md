### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Timothy Burr Finn. The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my software engineering skills to prospective employers. 

Specific portfolio projects are provided that target my knowledge of several programming languages (C++, C# and Python). Below you will find a link to three code repositories, one for each language. Inside each repository you will find a solution which can be downloaded and executed.

Each repository is solution of common software system solution. The reason of this is to demonstrate my understanding of cross-platform skills TBD.

The following software engineering skills that I have and wish to demonstrate are found in the software solutions:

- System Software Modeling
- Object Oriented Software Design
- Deployment Modeling
